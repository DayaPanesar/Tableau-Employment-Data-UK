# UK Employment Data Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to the UK Employment Data Analysis project! In this repository, I explore and analyze employment data for the UK using Tableau and Excel. The dataset was sourced from Tableau, and through a combination of data analysis and visualization, I aim to provide insights into the employment trends in the United Kingdom.

## Project Details

### Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is the British UK Employment Data, obtained from Tableau. The dataset includes relevant information about employment across various sectors and regions in the UK.

### Tools Used

- **Excel:** Excel was utilized for data cleaning, preprocessing, and additional analysis to ensure the data was suitable for visualization.

## Key Findings

**Regional Disparities:**
- Investigated whether employment changes are evenly distributed across different regions in Great Britain or if there are regional disparities.

**Industry Growth and Decline:**
- Identified industries that have experienced significant growth or decline in employment between 2011-2014.
